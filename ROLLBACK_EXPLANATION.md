# Rollback to Commit 35b9d89

## Overview
This branch represents a rollback of the main branch to commit `35b9d89528fc3b8ce7c4fcd5bf59ca6d715798be` ("Fix Python version mismatch in GitHub Actions workflow").

## Commits Being Rolled Back
The following commits will be undone if this rollback is merged to main:

1. **b49957a** - "Revert commit 2491a28d"
2. **7146602** - "Revert 'Update Python version and add Briefcase build steps for Linux'"  
3. **2491a28** - "Update Python version and add Briefcase build steps for Linux"

## Changes Summary
The rollback will:

### GitHub Actions Workflow (.github/workflows/build.yml)
- **Revert Python version**: Change from Python 3.12 back to Python 3.11
- **Revert action versions**: Change from newer action versions back to older ones
  - `actions/checkout@v4` → `actions/checkout@v2`
  - `actions/setup-python@v4` → `actions/setup-python@v2`
- **Remove Briefcase build steps**: Remove complex Linux build configuration with system dependencies
- **Simplify build process**: Return to simple pytest-based testing

### Files Removed
- `REVERT-2491a28d945d2d90e9eed09247dc9f88e9070300.md` - Revert documentation file
- `REVERT_COMMIT.md` - Commit revert documentation

## Impact Analysis

### Positive Impact
- **Stability**: Returns to a known working state (commit 35b9d89)
- **Simplicity**: Removes complex build configuration that may have been causing issues
- **Consistency**: Eliminates multiple revert commits that created confusion

### Potential Concerns
- **Lost Work**: Any improvements in the rolled-back commits will be lost
- **Python Version**: Reverts to Python 3.11 from 3.12
- **Build Features**: Loses Briefcase build capabilities for Linux

## Recommendation
This rollback should be considered if:
1. The recent changes caused build failures or instability
2. The Briefcase build configuration was not working correctly
3. A stable baseline is needed for further development

## Next Steps
If this rollback is approved:
1. The main branch will be reset to commit 35b9d89
2. Any useful changes from the rolled-back commits should be reapplied individually
3. Consider using `git cherry-pick` to selectively reintroduce working features
4. Test thoroughly before adding new build configurations

## Alternative Approaches
Instead of a full rollback, consider:
- Cherry-picking specific fixes from the rolled-back commits
- Creating targeted fixes for specific issues
- Incremental improvements rather than large configuration changes
