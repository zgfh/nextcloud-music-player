# This is a placeholder for the app icon
# In a real application, you would place actual icon files here:
# - icon.icns (for macOS)
# - icon.ico (for Windows)  
# - icon.png (for Linux and other platforms)
# - Various sizes for mobile platforms

# For now, the app will use default system icons
# You can create icons using tools like:
# - GIMP
# - Sketch
# - Figma
# - Online icon generators
